# umap_projection

This code enables the projection of single-cell RNA-seq profiles from one dataset into the UMAP embedding coordinates of a different dataset. While UMAP includes a "transform" function for this purpose, it does not allow the use of Spearman's correlation as a similarity metric. Spearman's correlation is particularly useful in this context because 1) the cluster_diffex pipeline uses Spearman's correlation as a similarity metric and 2) the non-parametric nature of Spearman's correlation allows projection of scRNA-seq data generated by completely different methods from that used in the original embedding.  For example, one could project SMART-seq data (e.g. TPM data) onto a UMAP embedding generated using 10x Genomics Chromium data (e.g. molecular counting data). This repository includes code for computing the transformation, generating figures, and also a modified version of umap_.py (the main UMAP executable) that can accommodate the use of Spearman's correlation coefficient as a similarity metric.
